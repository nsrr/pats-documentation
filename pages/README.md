## About

The Pediatric Adenotonsillectomy Trial for Snoring (PATS) study was a multi-centered, randomized, single-blinded, 12-month interventional study that compares the impact of adenotonsillectomy (AT) on measures of behavior, quality of life, and healthcare utilization in children aged 3-12 with mild sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), conducted from 2016 to 2022. This study aimed to clarify how to manage sleep-disordered breathing in children, focusing on several key issues: 1) assessing outcomes important to children and their families, including behavior, quality of life, and sleep disturbances; 2) exploring differences in treatment responses among children at higher risks for mild SDB, such as preschoolers, Black and Hispanic children, and those with asthma and/or obesity. Additionally, the study aimed to evaluate healthcare usage and investigate the impact of factors like secondhand smoke exposure, inadequate sleep, socioeconomic status, and family functioning on treatment effectiveness. Full details of the study design are found in the Supplemental material in the primary paper published in JAMA.

This study recruited children aged 3-12 who reported snoring at least 3 nights/week, AHI â‰¤ 3, no SpO2 < 90%, and tonsillar hypertrophy. Ineligibility was established based on the following criteria: history of previous tonsillectomy, recurrent tonsillitis, severe obesity with a BMI z-score greater than 3, presence of chronic health conditions other than asthma, significant developmental disability, Adaptive Behavior Assessment System (ABAS) score below 60, non-English speaking status, and intention to relocate from the area.

The study's coprimary endpoints are (1) change from baseline in executive behavior relating to self-regulation and organization skills as measured by the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) Global Composite Score (GEC); and (2) change from baseline in vigilance as measured on the Go-No-Go (GNG) signal detection parameter (d-prime).

The PATS dataset includes core demographic and minimal polysomnography (PSG) data from the screening visit, and additional cognitive behavioral, quality of life, sleep disordered breathing symptoms, anthropometry, blood pressure, tobacco exposure and immunoglobulin titers, healthcare use, PSG and actigraphy from randomized children from baseline and follow-up visits. The PSG data were obtained from the standard laboratory-based overnight sleep study from the baseline clinic visit  and 12-month follow-up visit. 7-day actigraphy was collected from children using Actiwatch 2 or Actiwatch Spectrum (Philips Respironics, Bend, OR) actigraph, and GT3X+ (ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL)  as part of the baseline examinations from 2016 to early 2020 (Actigraphy data collection stopped due to the COVID-19 pandemic .) Behavior and neuropsychological assessments including Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) and Go-No-Go (GNG) vigilance test were conducted at baseline and the 12-month follow up visit. Other demographic information and survey questionnaires such as Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Adaptive Behavior Assessment System, Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), were collected from baseline and follow-up visits.

**Important note on sample size: The core data set contains data on 920 children screened for the study, 459 children randomized, 306 children who underwent 12-month follow-up PSGs, and 298 children with baseline actigraphy. The NSRR PATS dataset was restricted to data from subjects who consented to future data sharing with investigators outside of the study team. Hence, the sample size included on NSRR is smaller than those reflected in existing PATS manuscripts. The NSRR PATS dataset contains data on 555 consented subjects and 330 randomized subjects.**

## Methods


## Data de-identification

All personally identifiable information (PII) has been removed from the data files by the NSRR team. For de-identification purposes, calendar dates were randomly offset within each subject by a random amount between -365 and +365 days.

## Access and usage restrictions

The PATS dataset is only available for non-commercial use.
